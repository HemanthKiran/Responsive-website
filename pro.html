      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools 
        (controlled and funded by the government at three levels:
         central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, 
        free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
        The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian 
        education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of 
        Indiaâ€™s constitutional states.the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system.

        ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India has maintained an average
        rolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group are 
        not enrolled in school has come down to Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different

        The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), conducted annually by Pratham and the National Achievement Survey (NAS), carried out 
        every three years by the central government, studies the state of the education system and highlights learning levels, enrolment 
        rates, and major gaps in the system, among other things.These reports reveal that while children are graduating to a higher class
        every year, very few are performing at their expected levels.The pandemic has prompted a shift to online education and this is 
        likely to further impact these trends. The ASER 2020 report revealed that 5.3 percent of rural children aged 6-10 years have not 
        enrolled in school this year, compared to 1.8 percent in 2018.
